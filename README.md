## Bank of React

Submisson of coding challenge for GA.

Your application should include:

- A React app built using the create-react-app package.
- Data pulled from existing API linked below. We recommend using the built-in fetch
  API in order to retrieve this data.

  - Use the API to display the data coming from the following endpoints:

    - https://bank-of-react-api.herokuapp.com/credits
    - https://bank-of-react-api.herokuapp.com/debits
    - https://bank-of-react-api.herokuapp.com/me

- Semantically clean JSX and JavaScript. Emphasize keeping components small and
  reusable. Use at least some CSS to design and organize the page.
- You must incorporate a few React concepts in your app:
  - Unidirectional Data Flow
  - Lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount
  - Making an API call inside a React App
- Your application should be clear and understandable, since your student facing code
  should be beginner friendly! Include comments or documentation briefly explaining
  your thought process and your code.
